CoAP/ACE PoC: Web application
=============================

This repository contains the web app part of the CoAP/ACE proof-of-concept implementation.
The firmware is written in Rust,
and designed to run on browsers that implement the [Web Bluetooth API].

[Web Bluetooth API]: https://webbluetoothcg.github.io/web-bluetooth/

**For an overview of what this does
and how it is used in practice, please see
[the corrresponding firmware's README file],
which explains the whole setup.**

Documentation on the implementation is [available through GitLab pages].

Typical issues
--------------

* "I changed something in the code, and now things are stuck at WASM load time with errors such as `Uncaught TypeError: Failed to resolve module specifier "env".`"

  This is the Rust-WASM-browser way of telling you that there are missing symbols
  (something the linker and wasm-bindgen can't tell you, for you might be providing them inside JavaScript).

  You can find out which they are by applying `wasm-dis` to the `public/*.wasm`, and looking for mentions of "env" -- these will point you to the missing symbol.
